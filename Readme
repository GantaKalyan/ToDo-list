# ToDo List
A simple ToDo List app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add tasks to their ToDo List, mark tasks as complete or incomplete, and delete tasks from the list.

## Features
Add tasks to the list by entering task names in the input box and clicking the "Add" button.
Mark tasks as complete or incomplete by clicking on them.
Delete tasks from the list by clicking on the "x" button next to each task.
